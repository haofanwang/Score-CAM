In this paper, we develop a novel post-hoc visual explanation method called Score-CAM based on class activation mapping. Score-CAM is a gradient-free visualization method, extended from Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++. It achieves better visual performance and fairness for interpreting the decision making process.
